            <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
            <p>
              Software development is always growing and we need to always
              learn, but I say some of us are missing soft skills to make the
              job easier for us. These are a few skills I have to help me become
              a better programmer, not just for me but for my team.

              <h3>Problem solving</h3>
              <p>
                I am a person who takes a big picture and dissects it into small
                segments to achieve the goal. I also like to put some
                imagination into what I tend to solve and other techniques I can
                use for the best output.

            <div class="item">
              <h3>Quick Thinker</h3>
              <p>
                Becoming a quick thinker is not always the best tool as we all
                need to ensure we produce the best work we can. But where I
                utilise these skills is when learning new things, once I learned
                Javascript I could grasp ES6 easy.

              <h3>Communication</h3>
              <p>
                Some people think that coding is a one mans job, well I don't
                think so, for a team to progress they need to work with one
                another. I wouldn't say my graphic skills are up there but
                working with a graphic designer and communicating on how to work
                within a project can help.
